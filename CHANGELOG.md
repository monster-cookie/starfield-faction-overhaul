# Venworks Faction Overhaul

## Version 2.0.4
* Ok finally got the original template actor system going again thought the NPCs wil vary +/- 15 levels (GAme Setting thing see RTFP config set them all to 1 if you want matched levels)
* The perk system only exists for the random buffs system which I'm working on still. Might have to wait for CK2 as its not sending the correct keywords up for some reason.
