# Venworks Faction Overhaul

## Version 1.0.3
* Typo on a non-used title on a Keyword title JaeDL found (English Majors).
* Removed the non-hostile hostile UC Troops 

## Version 1.0.2
* More terrormorphs from JaeDL all contested planets spawn terrormorphs. Sorry JaeDL I refuse to do all systems but figure the battles/wars would drag them out. 
* Sorry forgot to put in House Va'ruun factions document updated too. 

## Version 1.0.1
* Sorry JaeDL made us have terrormorphs 
* Kreet is also now Hostile Humans only but I'm not 100% sure that keyword is honored by PCM.
* REmoved and empty Strings folder that was being created in the archive

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
