# Venworks Faction Overhaul

## Version 2.0.7 [BETA]
* Fix for the scaled human's you have been encountering they are humans coming from the hostile humans random lists that I forgot to setup rules Starborn, Syndicate, and Van'ruun
* MCS_NPCOverrideAutomaticTitle.psc has to be completely rewritten due to now hitting the script property limit. This means you will need a new universe or game to reset the script cache.
