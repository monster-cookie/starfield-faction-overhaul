# Venworks Faction Overhaul

## Version 1.0.6
* New MCS Faction Definitions for Ecliptic, Crimson Fleet, Syndicate, The First, and Starborn.
* Stat scaling is a curve from 1 to 400 with a balanced record every 5 levels.
* Removing nested template levels this may be causing the stats to not apply. Sorry, this might have been hidden from me in my testing cause of Scale the World. 

## Version 1.0.5
* Finally ready to merge in the Modular Creation System (MCS) based on BGS's Creature System. I had to use template actors instead of OMODs, as the OMOD system requires engine support. 
* Only faction/human definitions for Spacers exist in this version next version depending on feedback will have all factions, classes, and spell packages available. 

## Version 1.0.4
* Fully utilizing StarSim's coming faction map
* Factions only need CrimeFaction for the starmap faction tag on the system and this doesn't mess up planetary looting as long as you don't put it at the planet level too. 
* Restructuring creature vs faction relations again to try and stop the blind attacking of peaceful creatures

## Version 1.0.3
* Typo on a non-used title on a Keyword title JaeDL found (English Majors).
* Removed the non-hostile hostile UC Troops 

## Version 1.0.2
* More terrormorphs from JaeDL all contested planets spawn terrormorphs. Sorry JaeDL I refuse to do all systems but figure the battles/wars would drag them out. 
* Sorry forgot to put in House Va'ruun factions document updated too. 

## Version 1.0.1
* Sorry JaeDL made us have terrormorphs 
* Kreet is also now Hostile Humans only but I'm not 100% sure that keyword is honored by PCM.
* REmoved and empty Strings folder that was being created in the archive

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
